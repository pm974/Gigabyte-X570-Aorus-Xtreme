OC - Gigabyte-X570-Aorus-Xtreme_rev1.0 - GC-Titan Ridge (NVM23E64fr)

This is my OC folder for Gigabyte-X570-Aorus-Xtreme_rev1.0 running Mac OS X Catalina 10.15.4 running n-d-k Opencore 0.5.7
Part of the SSDTs consists in patching USB (XHC0, XHC1, XHC2, XHCI & HXC4 for SSP1 & SSP2 on the GC-Titan Ridge PCIe Thunderbolt3 card.
• Proper Shutdown needs to be fixed in SSDT-X570-TB3-TTR.aml as it's lost when loaded.
